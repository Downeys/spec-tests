# Testing

Vitest for unit + integration. Playwright for the chat-UI E2E flow. `fast-check` for property-based tests on the domain layer. Coverage targets and enforcement vary per layer — flat targets produce ritual tests where they don't matter and miss coverage where they do.

## Runner choices

- **Vitest** for unit + integration. TS+ESM-native, fast, watch mode, parallel workers, integrates with `fast-check`.
- **Playwright Test** for the chat-UI E2E flow. Already implied by the Sandcastle Dockerfile baking in Playwright + Chromium.
- **`node:test`** is available but not used; Vitest's DX (built-in expect, watch UI, snapshot) wins for the costs of one extra dep.

## Per-layer coverage policy

| Layer                  | Coverage target                            | Test type                                                | Enforcement                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/domain`      | **≥ 90% gate, 95% target (line + branch)** | Pure unit; property-based for state machines and math    | **Gated** — pre-commit / CI fails below 90% |
| `packages/application` | **≥ 85% line**                             | Use-case tests with in-memory port stubs                 | **Report-only** — printed, not gated        |
| `packages/external/*`  | **No coverage target**                     | Integration tests against real services where reasonable | Tests gated to pass; coverage not enforced  |
| `apps/api`             | Smoke + Zod contract tests                 | Endpoint smoke, schema round-trips                       | Tests gated to pass                         |
| `apps/ui`              | **No coverage target**                     | A few Playwright smoke tests on the golden chat flow     | Smoke tests gated to pass                   |
| `apps/agent`           | Composition root, mostly untested          | Wiring integration test only                             | —                                           |

The 90%-gated / 95%-target rule on `packages/domain` is the load-bearing one. The domain layer is where bugs cause silent wrong answers about your business plan, and where the agent is most likely to skip tests without something forcing them. The 5% gap between gate and target is deliberate: 95% as a hard gate forces ritual tests on trivial getters and coverage-of-coverage games that corrupt the discipline; 90% as a hard gate stays tight on real behavior. Aim for 95%; the commit fails below 90%.

## Property-based testing on the domain

Required for state machines and pure math in `packages/domain`; encouraged elsewhere; optional in adapters.

Use `fast-check` to express invariants like:

```ts
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { test } from 'vitest';

test('transitioning to tested-supports preserves immutability of prior status', () => {
  fc.assert(
    fc.property(arbHypothesis(), arbCitations(), (h, citations) => {
      const before = h.status;
      h.testSupports(citations);
      // before is still the snapshot we captured
      expect(before).toMatchInlineSnapshot(/* ... */);
    }),
  );
});
```

The cost is real (property tests take longer to write than examples) but for hypothesis tracking, financial math, and citation aggregation — the parts of the domain where bugs cause silent wrong answers — property tests pay back many times over.

## Integration tests: real services or recorded fixtures

| Service                                                 | Strategy                                           | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Postgres / OpenBrain**                                | **Testcontainers** with `pgvector` extension       | Real schema, real migrations, real query plans. Cheap and fast in a container.                                                                                                                                |
| **Anthropic API (LLM + `web_search` tool)**             | **Recorded fixtures** with explicit re-record flag | Calls cost money and take seconds. Replay deterministically; re-record when the agent's prompt changes. The `web_search` tool's results are part of the same recorded message stream — one fixture mechanism. |
| **Voyage embeddings**                                   | **Recorded fixtures** with explicit re-record flag | Same reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Promotion fetcher (HTTP GET against arbitrary URLs)** | **Recorded fixtures** keyed by URL                 | Real fetches are non-deterministic (paywalls, redirects, content drift); fixtures pin the bytes for `span_hash` stability in tests.                                                                           |
| **Filesystem (wiki render)**                            | Real, in a tmp directory                           | No reason to mock; filesystem is fast.                                                                                                                                                                        |

**No mocking the database.** The team's prior pattern: mocked DB tests passed while a real prod migration broke. Integration tests for `packages/external/openbrain/` hit a real Postgres in testcontainers.

## Behavior-required test rule

Tests are required when introducing testable _behavior_:

- A new domain function
- A new invariant
- A new state-machine transition
- A new use-case orchestration
- A new parser, schema, or math routine

Tests are **not** required for:

- Type-only changes
- Dependency bumps
- Comment / doc edits
- Config tweaks
- UI cosmetic changes
- Log-message changes

This inherits verbatim from `.sandcastle/prompt.md`'s existing rule. The rationale: forcing tests on type-only changes produces theater tests that pass for the wrong reason and rot when the type changes.

## Test file layout

- Tests colocated with code: `foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts` in the same folder.
- Integration tests in `*.integration.test.ts` (separate suite, slower, can be `--exclude`'d in dev loop).
- E2E tests in `apps/ui/e2e/*.spec.ts` (Playwright's convention).
- `vitest.config.ts` at the workspace root configures per-package projects with the right thresholds.

## What to do when a test would be obviously theater

Don't write it. Instead, add a one-line note in the PR / commit explaining the work has no testable behavior. The pre-commit hook does not require _every_ change to add tests — it requires the test suite to _pass_ and (in the domain) coverage thresholds to hold. If you remove a tested behavior, remove the test in the same commit.
