# Language and types

TypeScript, run on Node, with strict-mode flags maxed and Zod parsing every external boundary.

## Why TS strict + Zod, not Effect-ts

Effect-ts is a stronger guarantee — its type system can refuse to compile code that violates architectural invariants the way TS+Zod cannot. We chose against it for this project because:

- The user is not yet familiar with Effect's `Layer` / `Schema` / `Effect` idioms; learning them alongside building a complex agent + experimenting with memory architectures would compound learning curves.
- For a single-operator personal project, "the lint rules + pre-commit hook + ADR review enforces the architecture" is good enough — _if_ the lint rules and pre-commit hook are taken seriously.

The trade-off: with Effect, the _compiler_ refuses to let you violate the architecture. With TS strict + Zod + ESLint, the _project_ refuses, but only because we wired up the rules to enforce it. If you `// @ts-expect-error` your way past a problem or skip a lint rule, the system rots. **Effect makes that rot impossible; we make it visible.**

Re-examine this choice in an ADR if Effect-ts familiarity grows or if architectural drift becomes painful.

## tsconfig strictness

The project's `tsconfig.json` sets _every_ strictness flag worth setting:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
  },
}
```

These catch whole classes of agent-introduced bugs. Expect lint failures often early on. **Soften specific rules only if a real false positive shows up — never globally relax for convenience.**

## Branded types for every domain identifier and value object

```ts
// in packages/domain/aggregates/business-plan/business-plan-id.ts
export type BusinessPlanId = string & { readonly _brand: 'BusinessPlanId' };

export const BusinessPlanId = (raw: string): Result<BusinessPlanId, ParseError> => {
  // validation here
};
```

- No raw `string` IDs cross a function boundary, ever.
- The factory in `packages/domain` is the _only_ place a brand is minted; consumers receive it pre-validated.
- Branded value objects (e.g. `EmailAddress`, `MoneyUSD`, `Url`) follow the same pattern.

## Zod at every boundary

Anything entering the system from outside our type-checked code gets Zod-parsed. **Parse, don't validate** — the schema generates the type via `z.infer`, so the runtime check and the static type can never disagree.

Boundaries that require Zod parsing:

- LLM output (every structured agent response)
- OpenBrain row (every read from Postgres)
- Web fetch (Anthropic `web_search` tool results, the OpenBrain promotion fetcher's HTTP responses, JSON APIs)
- HTTP request body / query / params (the chat API)
- Config files / environment variables at startup
- File reads where shape matters (frontmatter on wiki pages, etc.)

The schemas live next to the code that uses them, in the layer that owns the boundary (External adapters own the OpenBrain schemas; the API owns the HTTP schemas; etc.).

## Tagged unions for fallible operations in the domain layer

`throw` is reserved for _bug, kill the process_ — not for control flow. Domain functions that can fail return:

```ts
type Result<T, E> = { tag: 'ok'; value: T } | { tag: 'err'; error: E };
```

A custom ESLint rule (`local/no-throw-in-domain`, see [linting-and-tooling.md](linting-and-tooling.md)) bans `throw` inside `packages/domain/`. The `application` layer can lift `Result` into thrown errors at the API edge if it wants — but the domain itself stays totally exception-free.

Match on `tag` exhaustively (TS strict + `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` + `@typescript-eslint/switch-exhaustiveness-check` covers this). A new `tag` variant that isn't handled is a compile error.

## What this enables

- The "be critical of every finding" posture is structurally easier to enforce when every dataflow has a `Schema` parse at its boundary — untyped or string-typed agent outputs make hypothesis-tracking turn into ad-hoc string parsing.
- Branded IDs prevent accidental cross-aggregate mixing (a `BusinessPlanId` cannot be silently passed where a `HypothesisId` is expected).
- Tagged-union results force callers to handle both success and failure paths at compile time.

The rest of the architecture (see [architecture.md](architecture.md), [domain-modeling.md](domain-modeling.md)) is built on top of these primitives.
